auto swap succeded

lo is a loopback device. You can imagine it as a virtual network device that is on all systems, even if they aren't connected to any network. It has an IP address of 127.0.0.1 and can be used to access network services locally. For example, if you run a webserver on your machine and browse to it with Firefox or Chromium on the same machine, then it will go via this network device.

There is no wi-fi adapter listed.  lspci and lsusb may help you find them in the first place at which point you need to figure out why it isn't working.
